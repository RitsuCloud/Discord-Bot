#This keeps track of what features I want to add
#1 DONE:----Add adventure options for players, like adventure 1, adventure 2, etc. 
#2 Add player inventory system, to add more gameplay into the game rather than just walking around
#3 Back track where player have the option to go backward to where they were, maybe hard code it? or use a stack 


#2 At the beginning of the file there will be the list of items avaviable for 
# players to grab, they all initialize set to False
# then for scene where items are there, it will be after the "tag" contain:, then 
# for all the items in that scene we can just set inventory to True
# and for items that player don't have, just respond by saying you dont have "this" item
